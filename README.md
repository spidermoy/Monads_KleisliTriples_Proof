Monads in functional programming: a formalized proof of their equivalence with Kleisli triples
=======

“Being a language, mathematics may be used not only to inform but also, among other things, to seduce.”  
─Benoît Mandelbrot


“There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.”  
─Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky


“Category theory is a relatively young branch of pure mathematics that most computer scientists would consider esoteric”  
─Benjamin C. Pierce


This repository contains my work for obtain my computer scientist degree.

My work consisted in to formalize in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) basic concepts 
of Category Theory, and realize a formal verification of a proof of equivalence 
between monads and Kleisli triples.
